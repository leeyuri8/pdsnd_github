### Project Title
**A Python project using pandas to explore bikeshare data.**

### Description
The program takes user input for the city (e.g. Chicago), month for which the user wants to view data (e.g. January; also includes an 'all' option), and day for which the user wants to view data (e.g. Monday; also includes an 'all' option).

Upon receiving the user input, it goes ahead and asks the user if they want to view the raw data (5 rows of data initially) or not. Following the input received, the program prints the following details:
-The most pouplar month
-The most popular day of week
-The most popular start hour
-The most popular Start and End Station.
-The most frequent Start to End Station combination.
-The total travel time and average travel time
-The counts of user types and gender.
-The earliest, most recent and most common birth year.
-The first five individual trip data, if needed and more data if required.

Finally, the user is prompted with the choice of restarting the program or not.
